					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We're running to be Atlanta DSA's <strong>delegates to the 2021 DSA National Convention.</strong></li>
						<li>Delegate elections will be held online from <strong>Sunday, May 2 until Sunday, May 9.</strong></li>
						<li>As candidates, we represent differing perspectives from across Atlanta DSA. We're running together because <strong>we agree on key political questions and share a common vision for building DSA</strong> into a mass organization of the multiracial working class.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Our slate is based on a shared political vision for DSA. We believe that presenting a clear platform to membership will help create a climate of open and comradely political debate. We openly invite all who agree with this platform to reach out to us about working together. We place our politics in the open because we believe a truly democratic chapter must have regular, thorough, and challenging public discussions on strategy in which all members can participate.

					<h1 class="mx-auto mt-5 text-center">Our Platform</h1>

					<h2>For Democratic Socialism</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>As Democratic Socialists, our ultimate goal is to take state power, abolish the capitalist mode of production, and create <strong>a society where wealth and resources are controlled democratically</strong> to meet human needs, not to make profits for an elite few.</li>
						<li>We understand that <strong>labor creates all wealth</strong>, and that the working class, if organized, has leverage over society because of our important role in the economic system.</li>
						<li>To achieve our goals, we must organize a <strong>mass movement</strong> of working people to contest state power, establish a new form of government, and transform society.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>For DSA</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>DSA is a unique organization</strong> in the United States. It is not a think-tank, NGO, or Democratic Party pressure group, but an explicitly socialist organization that organizes class struggle and raises class consciousness.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA is positioned as the center of gravity</strong> for the socialist movement in the United States, and has a pivotal historic role to play in organizing the working class.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA should root itself in the multiracial working class</strong>, with a mass membership developed by recruiting ordinary, largely unorganized working people.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA maintains political independence</strong> by funding itself entirely from member dues and grassroots donations from the working class.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>For Unionism</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Organization is the strongest weapon workers have</strong> against the ruling class. Because our labor creates the capitalists’ wealth, withholding our labor is the only way to hit them where it hurts.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA should train its members to organize their workplaces</strong> by starting new unions or expanding existing ones. Virtually all DSA members are workers, and as such it is in our interests to organize ourselves.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA should actively collaborate with and reinvigorate existing unions</strong> to strengthen organized labor and unite workers through organizing drives and political campaigns.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>For Socialist Electoral Campaigns</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Electoral campaigns are a key avenue for politically activating ordinary people.</strong> The role of the Bernie campaigns in reinvigorating and cohering the socialist movement proves this. It was correct for DSA to endorse and campaign for Bernie in 2020.</li>
						<li><strong>DSA should build strong canvassing and phone banking operations</strong> to elect working class candidates and keep them accountable through reliance on our support.</li>
						<li><strong>We must cultivate a Democratic Socialist constituency</strong> among the multiracial working class, particularly among young, Latinx, and Black workers — this entails fighting for universal suffrage and expanding the electorate.</li>
						<li>We support DSA’s largely successful approach of <strong>strategically running socialist candidates using the Democratic ballot line.</strong></li>
					</ul>

					<h2>For Intentional Recruitment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We acknowledge that DSA currently has disproportionately more white, male, professional, degreed, and childless members.</li>
						<li><strong>We believe DSA must be proactive in diversifying our ranks.</strong> This means cultivating a composition that is diverse racially, with respect to gender and sexual orientation, immigration status and native language, disability, and income.</li>
						<li>We must <strong>engage in campaigns and political work that align us with the multiracial working class</strong> - by supporting the #BlackLivesMatter movement, defending immigrant workers, campaigning for gender equality and fighting to defund and abolish the police.</li>
						<li>We must <strong>make DSA more accessible</strong> and make it easier for supporters, non-activists and casual members to participate without having to attend regular meetings.</li>
						<li><strong>We must support and elevate people of marginalized identities</strong> through training, political education, and intentional leadership development.</li>
						<li>We believe DSA should <strong>aim to represent the whole working class</strong> and consciously ask members of marginalized groups to join and take ownership in our organization.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>For a Strong Organization</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>We are proud to be DSA members</strong> and we are committed to strengthening DSA both nationally and locally.</li>
						<li><strong>We support a strong national organization</strong> because we believe that the strength of DSA’s national organization relates directly to the strength of chapters — local chapters need more support, training, and resources that can best be provided by more full-time staff.</li>
						<li><strong>We want a strong National Political Committee</strong> that is thoughtful and decisive and that has the support to follow through on its decisions and mandates.</li>
					</ul>
